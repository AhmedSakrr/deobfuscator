    PLEASE READ ENTIRELY BEFORE POSTING
    If this issue is about deobfuscating a file, you must have actually tried to run the deobfuscator first.
    Simply uploading a file without any information will most likely get your issue ignored.
    Instead, tell us what you've tried, what the detect option (which is very helpful in finding transformers)
    found, and any other useful information (errors) that may be helpful.

    In addition, please look into the FAQ at the bottom of the readme AND the commonerrors folder
    to make sure you're not making one of the common errors. (You should always read General.md!)
    PLEASE do not skip this step, it will most likely help!
    
    Please make sure that you've provided a copy of the file if possible. Files that are copyrighted
    (e.g. not freely available on the internet or Minecraft clients that have Mojang classes shaded)
    are not allowed to be uploaded. In that case, you may want to decompile and search for the relevant decryption classes
    and upload the screenshots instead, but just make sure class names are not visible!
    
    You should also provide a copy of the config/code you're using to run the deobfuscator.
    Order of transformers matter, and sometimes you just need to switch them around.
    Please paste the config/code in a code block. Here's how to do that: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code-and-syntax-highlighting
    
    Thank you!
